# Lisa's MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project was to 
practice all the skills necessary to make a fully functioning one-page React application with routing and 
API calls.  This project was created by forking and cloning https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter 

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Installation

To get started developing right away:
* clone or download this project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* have fun - life is short!

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

It would just be silly to contribute to this project.
